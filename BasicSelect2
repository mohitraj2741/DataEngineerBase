Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.
The STATION table is described as follows:
#sql
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) 
FROM STATION
WHERE (ID % 2) = 0;

#pySpark
even_id_cities_df = station_df.filter(col("ID") % 2 == 0).select("CITY").distinct()

even_id_cities_df.show()

#sparkSql
station_df.createOrReplaceTempView("STATION")

result_df = spark.sql("""
    SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) 
    FROM STATION
    WHERE MOD(ID, 2) = 0
""")

result_df.show()
